JavaScript Climate Data Analyzer

Create two files:

index.html - Copy and paste the HTML code into this file

climate-analyzer.js - Copy and paste the JavaScript code into this file

Make sure the files are in the same folder/directory on your computer.

Open the HTML file in a web browser:

Double-click the index.html file
Or right-click the file and select "Open with" and choose your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

Using the program:
The page should load with input fields for Start Year and Initial Temperature

Click "Load Climate Data" to generate and display sample data

Click "Analyze Data" to see statistics and visualizations

Click "Predict Future" to see projected temperatures

That's it! No special server or setup is needed since this is all client-side JavaScript that runs directly in your browser.

Submitting this AP CS Principles project, remember to capture all the code as a PDF to submit. 
WE can use the browser's print function (CTRL+P or CMD+P)
