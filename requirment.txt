Requirements:

User Input: Gets starting year and temperature from user, with buttons that trigger event handling.

List/Collection: Uses arrays to store temperature data, years, and predictions, making it easy to add/modify data without changing the code structure.

Custom Procedures:
analyzeTemperatureData() with parameters and return value
predictFutureTemperatures() with parameters and return value

Both contribute to the program's purpose

Algorithm with sequencing, selection, and iteration:
Both main functions use loops, conditionals, and sequential processing
Calculates trends, identifies anomalies, and makes predictions

Procedure Calls: The custom procedures are called when the user clicks buttons

Output: Displays results as text, tables, and even a simple ASCII visualization
The program demonstrates real-world relevance by tackling climate data analysis
